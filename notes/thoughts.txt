Things I observed:

1. Passing memories in by reference takes a lot longer to simulate compared to
having everything in one main component, or doing things the 'hard way'. 

2. It was really enjoyable to write things in Calyx. It was easy to reason 
about how the hardware should function and easy to express. It felt like a
good balance between writing in a traditional HDL and writing in a high
level language. I tried to take advantage of Calyx's par structure, which
required me to instantiate a lot of components and create wire groups for 
each of them to run. This got very repetitive, and I wasn't sure if there
was a better way to do this.
