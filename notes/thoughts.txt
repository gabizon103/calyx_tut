Things I observed:

1. Passing memories in by reference takes a lot longer to simulate compared to
having everything in one main component. This was a little unfortunate because
I preferred designing things in separate modules, but simulation took so long
that it was not practical. TODO: look at the generated Verilog code in both cases.

2. For some reason, the version of the multiplier that uses a separate dot product
component does not work. However, the one that has everything in one single module 
does work. The logic is the same, I literally copied most of it over.

3. It was really enjoyable to write things in Calyx. It was easy to reason 
about how the hardware should function and easy to express. It felt like A
good balance between writing in a traditional HDL and writing in a high
level language.

TODO: try decreasing the amount of cycles it takes to run by doing
things in parallel
